### **3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?**  

| **Methodology** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Agile** | - Flexible and adaptive to changes.  <br> - Encourages continuous feedback and improvement. <br> - Faster time-to-market with incremental releases. | - Requires strong team collaboration and communication. <br> - Difficult to predict exact timeline and budget. <br> - Not ideal for projects with strict regulatory requirements. |
| **Waterfall** | - Clear structure with defined stages.  <br> - Easier to estimate time, cost, and effort. <br> - Works well for projects with stable requirements. | - Less flexible and difficult to accommodate changes. <br> - Late-stage issues can be costly and time-consuming. <br> - Long development cycles before getting user feedback. |

### **4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?**  
**Agile is more beneficial for:**  
- **Startups and fast-changing environments** (e.g., a mobile app with frequent updates).  
- **Customer-driven products** (e.g., SaaS applications with continuous improvements).  
- **Software with unclear or evolving requirements** (e.g., AI-driven recommendation engines).  

**Waterfall is more beneficial for:**  
- **Government or regulatory-compliant projects** (e.g., medical software requiring FDA approval).  
- **Large-scale enterprise solutions** (e.g., banking systems where stability is key).  
- **Projects with fixed requirements** (e.g., building an ATM software system).

### **5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?**  
**Methods for Quality Assurance:**  
- **Automated and manual testing:** Use Selenium, JUnit, or Postman for API testing.  
- **Code reviews:** Peer review practices to catch errors early.  
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Automate testing and deployment.  
- **User acceptance testing (UAT):** Ensure software meets business needs before launch.  
- **Performance testing:** Identify and resolve bottlenecks before deployment.  

**Importance of High Standards:**  
- Ensures reliability and security of the software.  
- Reduces long-term maintenance costs.  
- Enhances user satisfaction and trust.  
- Prevents reputational damage due to software failures.

### **6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?**  
**Defining Project Scope:**  
- Prevents scope creep (uncontrolled changes that extend project timelines).  
- Sets clear expectations for stakeholders.  
- Helps allocate resources efficiently.  

**Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**  
- A hierarchical decomposition of the project into manageable sections.  
- Helps in assigning responsibilities and tracking progress.  
- Facilitates accurate time and cost estimation.  

---

### **7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?**  
**Benefits of a Detailed Project Schedule:**  
- Ensures task dependencies are accounted for.  
- Improves time management and accountability.  
- Helps in tracking progress and identifying delays early.  

**How Gantt Charts Help:**  
- Provide a visual timeline of tasks and milestones.  
- Show dependencies between tasks to prevent bottlenecks.  
- Allow for easy rescheduling when needed.  

---

### **8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?**  
- The software should solve a **real and urgent problem** (e.g., inefficiencies, security risks, high costs).  
- The problem should **directly impact** users (e.g., businesses losing customers due to slow processes).  
- A significant problem ensures **high adoption and demand** for the software.  

Example: If the software is an AI-powered chatbot for customer service, the issue might be **slow response times in customer support**, which leads to customer dissatisfaction and revenue loss.
